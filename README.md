# car-quality
 In this project, we will use Decision Tree and Random Forest Algorithm to predict car class (unacceptable, acceptable, good, very-good) based on multiple factors (buying price, safety, door number...)
 Because all variables are categorical, One-Hot Encoding will be used to transform data into numerical values. 

 Random Forest Algorithm has multiple parameters so we will use GridSearchCV to find the best possible combination of parameters. 
 The we will compare accuracy score for both algorithms.
